        <h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack software developer trained to finesse at microverse.org and specialize
          in building software solutions for small businesses. I love coding specifically because I
          love the puzzle-solving aspect of it. Although I have predominantly been working with
          JavaScript and Ruby, I have a fair bit of experience with C, C++, Python, and Java and
          have had the opportunity to work with Matlab and Arduino.

          <br />
          <span>
            I have built over 40 different projects with different technologies and stacks. These
            include a full-stack Ruby on Rails budget web app: Spend Right, which enables users to
            manage their finances by keeping all their transactions in categories and tracking how
            much they spend in each category and on each expense.
          </span>
          <br />

          I have also had the honor to work as a code reviewer at <span>Microverse</span>, where I
          have reviewed more than 50 different codebases, enforcing DRY and clean code and helping
          students resolve bugs and semantic errors, drastically improving the efficiency and
          performance of their codebases and getting them unblocked on their projects.

        <h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>
          <span> 1. The Coder's Journey </span>
          <br />

          From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I was captivated by the art of
          puzzle-solving—how logic and creativity weave together to build solutions that make a
          difference. What started as curiosity soon became a passion, driving me to master the
          intricacies of software development. With over 8 years of coding experience and about 2
          years as a professional full-stack developer, I've honed my skills in Dart, Flutter,
          JavaScript, React, and TypeScript, embracing the philosophy of clean, maintainable, and
          efficient code.

          <br />
          <br />
          <span> 2. Crafting Solutions </span>
          <br />

          I thrive on creating software that doesn't just work but works beautifully. My projects
          range from comprehensive web apps to desktop applications, each designed to solve
          real-world problems. One of my notable works is a full-stack Ruby on Rails app, Spend
          Right, which helps users manage their finances by categorizing transactions and
          visualizing spending habits. I'm also building a book progress tracker that combines my
          love for reading with my passion for development—helping readers organize their literary
          journeys with ease.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span> 3. The Code Reviewer's Eye </span>
          <br />
          During my time as a code reviewer at Microverse, I had the privilege of reviewing over 50
          codebases, guiding aspiring developers to write cleaner and more efficient code. It was
          here that I truly grasped the impact of mentorship—the way a well-timed suggestion can
          unblock a project and boost a developer's confidence. Enforcing DRY principles and clean
          code practices not only improved my own skills but also deepened my appreciation for the
          elegance of simplicity in software design.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span> 4. Beyond the Code </span>
          <br />
          While I love the logic and precision of programming, I'm equally drawn to the human side
          of technology—the connections it builds, the stories it enables, and the lives it
          improves. I once managed routine checks on incubators in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
          (NICU) during an internship, a role that taught me the importance of precision, empathy,
          and accountability—qualities I strive to embody in both my personal and professional life.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span> 5. The Road Ahead </span>
          <br />
          The world of technology is ever-evolving, and so is my journey. I find myself constantly
          exploring new languages, frameworks, and methodologies, not just to keep up but to push
          the boundaries of what I can create. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of
          full-stack development and custom backend solutions, as seen in my current projects. As I
          continue to build and learn, I remain open to collaborations, new ideas, and opportunities
          to turn code into something meaningful.
